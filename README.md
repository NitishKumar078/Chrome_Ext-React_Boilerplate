```

## 📋 Available Scripts

Once your project is created, you can run the following commands:

### `npm run dev`
Starts the Webpack development server with watch mode and automatic extension reloading. Perfect for active development.

### `npm run build`
Creates an optimized production build using Webpack in the `dist` folder, ready for packaging and publishing to the Chrome Web Store.


## 📁 Project Structure

After creating your extension, you'll get a project structure like this:

```
my-extension/
├── public/
│   ├── icons/
│   │   ├── icon16.png
│   │   ├── icon48.png
│   │   └── icon128.png
│   └── manifest.json
├── src/
│   ├── background/
│   │   └── background.js
│   ├── content/
│   │   └── content.js
│   └── popup(react app)/
│       ├── App.jsx
│       ├── App.css
│       └── index.jsx
│   
├── package.json
├── webpack.config.js
├── webpack.dev.js
├── webpack.prod.js
└── README.md
```

### Key Components

- **`src/popup/`**: React 19-based popup interface that appears when users click the extension icon
- **`src/background/`**: Service worker script that handles extension lifecycle and background tasks
- **`src/content/`**: Content script that runs in the context of web pages
- **`public/manifest.json`**: Chrome Extension manifest file (Manifest V3)
- **`public/icons/`**: Extension icons in required sizes

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Load Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select your project's `dist` folder
5. Your extension is now loaded and ready for testing!

### 3. Development Tips

- **Auto-reload**: The extension automatically reloads when you make changes
- **Console debugging**: Use Chrome DevTools to debug different parts:
  - **Popup/react app**: Right-click extension icon → "Inspect popup"
  - **Background**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` → Click "background page"
  - **Content Script**: Use regular DevTools on any webpage

### 4. Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The `dist` folder will contain your packaged extension ready for the Chrome Web Store.

## 🛠️ Customization

### Modify Manifest
Edit `public/manifest.json` to customize permissions, content scripts, and other extension settings.

### Add Dependencies
```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

### Styling
- Use CSS modules, styled-components, or any CSS framework
- Tailwind CSS can be easily integrated
- CSS files are automatically processed by Webpack
